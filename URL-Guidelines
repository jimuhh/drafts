# URL Standards

URLs are a highly visible attribute of your content that impacts user experience, accessibility, and search rankings.  The URL of a page specifies the page's name and location within VA.gov. 

## About URLs
- URLs consists of a domain, sub-directories (optional), and a page name.  
- A good URL helps users AND search engines by providing: 
  - A high-level description of what the content is about
  - The location of the content within your site 
  - An indication of the priority of the content based on the depth (i.e. number of sub-directories in the URL path) of the content
  - Information about how the content is related to other content within your site.

Good URLs also help people who build and edit the website to:
  - Locate the correct files to work on
  - Understand where they fit in the website hierarchy, and 
  - Easily share that information with other team members and stakeholders
