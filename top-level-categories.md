Thanks! 
Now that you've spent some time creating categories for things, we'd like you to 
- Think about the categories you just created, and 
- Come up with **two top-level** categories to hold them

**For example,** if you sorted some of your cards into these three categories

| Cats | Dogs  | Aquarium fish  |  
|---|---|---|
| Tabby |  Beagle | Goldfish  |  
| Siamese  | Golden Retriever  |  Betta |   
|  Maine Coon | Labradoodle  | Guppy  | 
|   |  |  |   |

And the rest into these three categories:

| Melons | Citrus | Berries |  
|---|---|---|
| Cantaloupe | Oranges| Strawberries  |  
| Honeydew  | Grapefruit | Blueberries |   
| Watermelon | Lemons  | Boysenberries  | 
|   |  |  |   |



1. Your **first** top-level category might be "**PETS.**"
1. and your **second** might be "**FRUIT**"

Got it? **Great!**
