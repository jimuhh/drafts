**First message:**

Hi. Thanks so much for agreeing to participate in **Ad Hoc's People Skills Card Sort!** We'll be sharing the study link with you shortly. 
A few things:
- It shouldn't take more than 15 or 20 minutes of your time. 
- Because it's an unmoderated study, you can do it whenever you have a small block of time on your calendar. 
- The study will close on March 7th, so please try and finish it before the middle of next week. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ping Jim or Kevin in this channel. 
**Note:** We won't be able to advise you on which cards you should group together or what you should name your categories, but we can provide technical support and explain instructions if needed. 

**Thanks!**
Jim, Kevin and Tyrell
